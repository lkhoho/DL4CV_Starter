## Parameterized Learning

Parameterization: a process of defining the necessary parameters of a given model, involving four key components,
    1) data
    2) a scoring function
    3) a loss function
    4) weights and biases

1) Data
    Input data we are going to learn from.
2) Scoring function
    Accepts data as input and maps the data to class labels.
3) Loss function
    Quantifies how well the predicted labels agree with our ground-truth labels. Lower loss function values means
    higher classification accuracy, at least on the training set.
4) Weights and biases
    Weight matrix (denoted as W) and bias vector (denoted as b) are called the weights or parameters of our classifier
    that we'll actually be optimizing.
